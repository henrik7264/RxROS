# RxROS

RxROS a domain specific language for programming robots.

## Introduction

This code is part of my Master Thesis at ITU, Copenhagen Denmark.
As the title indicates is the goal to produce a DSL for programming robots.
The DSL will be based on Reactive C++ and ROS.
<p> 
Part of the thesis is to build a Lego Mindstorms NXT robot.
The robot will be used to gain experiences with programming robots.

Please feel free to comment and use the code as you like.
My hope is that it will bring inspriation and fun to everyone.

## Setup and installation

In order to make use of this software you must
install the following software on your computer:

### Ubuntu Bionic (18.04)

You can download an image of the Ubuntu Bionic Linux distribution at<br>
https://www.ubuntu.com/#download<br>
I found it useful in addition to add the following packages:

```
sudo apt-get install git doxygen graphviz-* meld cmake
sudo apt-get install emacs gtcreator qt5-*
sudo apt-get install tree gimp
```

### ROS Melodic Morenia

Installation instruction of how to install ROS Melodic Morenia can be found at<br>
http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu<br>
Execute the following commands to install ROS Melodic Morenia:

```
 sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list' 
 sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116 
 sudo apt-get update 
 sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-desktop-full 
 sudo rosdep init 
 rosdep update 
 echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc 
 sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential
 sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-joy ros-melodic-teleop-twist-keyboard
 sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-navigation
```

### NXT-ROS

NXT-ROS is a github project found at<br> 
https://github.com/NXT-ROS/nxt<br>
The installation process of NXT-ROS is a bit complicated, but here is the procedure I got working:<br>
Start to install the nxt-python package. NXT-ROS will not work without it!

```
sudo apt-get install libnxt nxt-python 
```

Create then a lego group and add the udev USB definition for the NXT controller:

```
sudo groupadd lego 
sudo usermod -a -G lego $(id -un) 
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0694", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660"' > /tmp/70-lego.rules && sudo mv /tmp/70-lego.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/70-lego.rules 
reboot
```

Finally, execute the following commands in a directory where you keep your ROS workspaces - any directory will work.

```
mkdir â€“p nxt 
cd  nxt 
git clone --recursive https://github.com/NXT-ROS/nxt.git src
catkin_make
cd ..
mkdir -p nxt_teleop/src
cd nxt_teleop/src
git clone --recursive https://github.com/NXT-ROS/nxt_teleop.git
cd ..
catkin_make
cd ..
```

### Reactive C++

Reactive C++ is also a github project. It can be found at<br>
https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp<br>
To install RxCpp execute the following commands:

```
git clone --recursive  https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp.git 
cd RxCpp 
mkdir -p projects/build 
cd projects/build 
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -B. ../CMake 
make 
sudo make install 
```

After the installation has completed you can remove the RxCpp directory.
The needed C++ header files have been installed in /usr/include/rxcpp.

### RxROS

Finally, we have come to the RxROS project. To install RxROS do the following:
